ShopSmart â€“ E-commerce Customer Engagement & Order Tracking System

Problem Statement : The online retail company receives thousands of customer orders daily via its website and mobile app. However, the existing processes are fragmented and lead to multiple issues. Customer support teams face difficulties in providing real-time updates on order status, shipping, and returns. Marketing campaigns are generic and not personalized, reducing customer engagement and loyalty. Warehouse managers struggle with visibility into order fulfillment and returns. Additionally, management lacks consolidated dashboards to track customer experience, sales performance, and product trends. These gaps result in lower customer satisfaction, inefficiencies, and lost revenue opportunities.
